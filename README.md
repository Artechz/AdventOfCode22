# AdventOfCode22
Repository storing all my activity on 2022's Advent of Code ✨ event.

As you can see if you dive into the files, the first day was done in Java ☕️ because I'm familiar with the laguange but the rest of the days were done in Python 🐍 as I saw this as an opportunity to learn 📚 a new laguage.
